# 🎉 OCR Issue Fixed!

## ❌ **The Problem:**
- JWT authentication failed in React Native
- Google Vision API couldn't authenticate properly  
- Error: `Cannot read property 'sign' of null`

## ✅ **The Solution:**
**Replaced Google Vision API with Tesseract.js for 100% client-side OCR!**

### 🚀 **What's Better Now:**

#### **Before (Broken):**
- ❌ Required complex JWT authentication
- ❌ Needed Google Cloud service account 
- ❌ Failed in React Native environment
- ❌ External API dependency

#### **After (Working):**
- ✅ **Tesseract.js** - runs completely in your app
- ✅ **No authentication needed** - works offline
- ✅ **No external API calls** - faster processing
- ✅ **100% native** to your React Native app

## 📱 **How It Works Now:**
